#Migrations, Models, Seeders & Relationships research 

- hasOne
- hasMany
- belongsTo
- belongsToMany

Explain:

- Which side owns the foreign key? &  Where each method is written ?

#in onetoone relation ship anyone of them can own the foreign key and we process it like
user.php have function profile() hasone(profile::class) 
and profile.php have function user() belongsto(user::class) and here is the foreign key (where you put the belongto) 

# in one to many relation ship the foreign key must be in the many side like one user have many profiles , here the user.php have function profile() hasmany(profile::class) and 
profile.php have function user() belongto(profile::class) where here is the foreign key


-what is seeder?
a php class in Laravel used to insert data into the database automatically.


-Why seeders are important in development?

seeders allow you to insert data into the database using code instead of writing SQL queries.
They automatically fill the database with realistic or test data, saving time and making it easier to test features.

-How seeders help simulate real data?

#especially when used with factories, seeders can generate random data based on specific conditions specified in the seeder and insert it automatically into the database.
This allows developers to test the application with realistic data without manually entering everything.

-Difference between seeding and manual database inserts?

#Seeding inserts data into the database automatically using code, without writing SQL queries.
#Manual inserts require writing SQL queries or entering data by hand



#####Part 2 #####
(users,subjects,booking,reviews)
#Why you chose these tables?
because this tables represents the main idea of my project


-How they are connected?
 user->booking one-to-many relationship
users-> reviews one-to-many relationship
subjects-> booking one-to-many 

#####Part 4 #####


-Why this relationship type was chosen?
#(user->booking)one user can have many bookings, but each booking belongs to only one user.
#(users->review) one user can write many reviews, but each review belongs to only one user.
#(subject->booking)one subject can have many bookings, but each booking is for only one subject.

- Which table contains the foreign key?
#(user->booking) here foreign key in booking table (student_id) & (teacher_id)
#(users->review) here foreign key in reviews table (user_id)
#(subject->booking) here foreign key in booking table as (subject_id)





- Why the seeding order matters?
#When you seed your database in Laravel, some tables depend on others because of foreign key relationships.
If a table depends on another table, the table it depends on must be seeded first.
Otherwise, you’ll get foreign key errors because the related data doesn’t exist yet.

- How relationships affect seeded data
#Database relationships (One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many) determine what data must exist before inserting new data.



Provide a short document that includes:

Tables overview:-

#users(id, name, email, password, timestamps)
#subjects(id, name, description, user_id (FK), timestamps)
#booking(id, booking_date, location, student_id (FK), teacher_id (FK), timestamps)
#reviews(id, comment, rating, booking_id (FK), student_id (FK), teacher_id (FK), timestamps)


Relationships diagram (simple sketch or description)
Users
 hasMany -> Subjects
 hasMany -> Bookings (as student)
 hasMany -> Bookings (as teacher)
 hasMany -> Reviews (as student & teacher via Bookings)

Subjects
 belongsTo -> Users (teacher/creator)

Bookings
 belongsTo -> Users (student)
 belongsTo -> Users (teacher)
 hasOne → Reviews

Reviews
 belongsTo -> Bookings
 belongsTo -> Users (student)
 belongsTo -> Users (teacher)


Explanation of:
Migration →Table → Model → Seeder →Database

-Migration:PHP class defining the table structure
-Table:Actual table created in the database by running migrations.
-Model:PHP class to interact with the table (CRUD operations)
-seeder:Inserts sample or initial data into the table for testing
-database:Final populated database ready for the application 

Why this structure is suitable for your project idea

This structure is flexible, scalable, and maintains clean relationships, perfect for testing and expanding features.
